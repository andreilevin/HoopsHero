    with expand_faq1:
        
        st.write('''It's well known among basketball lovers that an NBA player's salary often doesn't reflect his true market value.  Most players play on guaranteed multi-year contracts, over the course of which their performance may improve or deteriorate, often dramatically;  yet their salaries remain locked-in.  A useful method for determining any player's fair market value could prove worthwhile both for team executives (to exploit inefficiencies and assemble a competitive team on a budget) and for regular fans (to quantify how overpaid or underpaid their favorite players really are).
        
What, then, is an NBA player's true market value?  To answer this most pressing of society's questions, I came up with a simple but surprisingly powerful approach. Every year, out of several hundred NBA players, about 150 become free agents and sign new contracts.  My idea here was to focus exclusively on this subset of players in line for a new contract, to see if I could train a model to predict their new salaries from their previous year's stats.  

By looking at all free agents over the course of several years, we can use machine learning techniques to uncover a mapping from a player's stats in the last year of his contract to his resulting new salary the following year.  The key insight is that once we have this mapping in hand, we can then retroactively apply it to ALL players (not just free agents).  In other words, we can answer the question: "*If Player X were a free agent this year*, what kind of new salary would he command based on his current stats?"  It is important to note that my model is not making a normative judgment ("this is a good player/ this is a bad player").  Rather, it is saying: "in the recent past, players in line for a new contract‚Äî with stats like those of Player X this year‚Äî could expect to get Salary Y."  ''', unsafe_allow_html=True)

A Random Forest is an ensemble model consisting of thousands of Decision Trees, with each tree constructed from a random bootstrapped sample of players in the training set; each node on each tree is split using a random sample of the feature (input) variables. The values of hyperparameters such as maximum tree depth and  number of features considered at each node were arrived at via grid search optimization.

For my classification target variable, I grouped the free agent next-year salaries into seven buckets: \$0-5M, \$5-10M, \$10-15M, \$15-20M, \$20-25M, \$25-30M, and \$30M+, and chose accuracy as my optimization metric.  Importantly, I made sure to balance these seven classes before model training, to prevent model bias toward the dominant class (after all, over half of all players earn \$0-5M, so a reasonably accurate but utterly useless model could just naively guess this class every time!).''', unsafe_allow_html=True)

For each player, I  used his stats in the final year of his old contract as the feature (input) variables and his new salary the following year as the target (output) variable. I also normalized each salary by that year's salary cap , since teams evaluate salaries as a percentage of the salary cap, rather than by the specific dollar amount. 

This gave me 744 total entries (or about 150 free agents per year).  First, I took all the entries from 2020 and siloed them away from my own prying eyes, to use later as a holdout set for testing final model performance.  I then used stratified sampling to split the remaining entries from 2015 to 2019 into a training set (for learning model parameters) and a validation set (for comparing different models and tuning hyperparameters).   

After settling on final model hyperparameter values using the validation set, I trained a model on the combined training + validation sets and evaluated its performance using the 2020 holdout set. Finally, I recombined all 744 entries (training + validation + holdout) and used this full dataset to train a final model with the same hyperparameters as above.

3. <font color=blue>**Games Started/Games Played:**</font>  The fraction of a player's games that he started. 
4. <font color=blue>**Games Started/Team Games:**</font> The fraction of a team's total games that a player started (normally the denominator is 82, but slightly fewer games were played in the 2019 and 2020 Covid-shortened seasons.)
5. <font color=blue>**Usage Percentage:**</font>  The fraction of team possessions with the player on the court that end in him shooting the ball, turning it over, or getting to the free throw line. 
6. <font color=blue>**Offensive Box Plus/Minus (OBPM):**</font> A box score-based metric that estimates a player‚Äôs contribution to the team offense while that player is on the court, measured in points above league average per 100 possessions played. 
7. <font color=blue>**Value Over Replacement Player (VORP):**</font>  Similar to Offensive Box Plus/Minus above, but also takes into account a player's defensive contributions and scales with playing time and number of games played.
8. <font color=blue>**Win Shares (WS):**</font>  An advanced stat that aims to assign credit for team wins to individual player performance. Win Shares are calculated using player, team and league-wide statistics, with the end result that the sum of player win shares on a given team will be roughly equal to that team‚Äôs win total for the season.


It was heartening to see that this set of features included both rate stats (measuring player performance per minute or per possession) and volume stats (taking into account playing time as well), since a truly valuable player should demonstrate good performance on both.

However, it would do no good to be 68% accurate if the remaining 32% misclassified entries were all over the map (for example by frequently classifying \$0-5M value players as having a value of \$25-30M, or vice versa).

The 32% remaining misclassified players make up the off-diagonal elements. A certain amount of misclassification is to be expected, since our set of 8 features cannot possibly account for the myriad quantifiable and unquantifiable variables that actually determine a player's salary.

But recall that the question we are trying to answer is: "what new salary would Player X command if he became a free agent this year?"  By NBA rules, the maximum allowable salary in the first year of a new contract currently ranges from \$28.1M to \$39.3M, depending on how long the player has been in the league (in subsequent years of the contract, the salary can and does increase beyond this range, as we clearly see with Mr. Curry above). 

Empirically speaking, if a player is talented enough to be eligible for a salary of \$30M+, teams will generally offer the highest salary available to him, rather than a few million less (the NBA is very much a star-driven league, so teams try to avoid potentially antagonizing star players or their agents).  As far as market value goes, there is thus hardly any difference between a \$30M/year player and a \$40M/year player, and it makes sense to group all such "max players" into a single \$30M+ bucket.
